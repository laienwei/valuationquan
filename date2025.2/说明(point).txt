2025年2月20日爬虫运行只成功了所有指数区，而首页指数的爬取又失败了。且2月22日才发现。2月28日整理数据时才注意到，指数399427、399690和399691不知何时已被国证指数公司悄悄下线。取而代之的是39936501和39943901。经查雪球网站，方知消失的三条指数最后一根K线为2024年4月22日。
On February 20, 2025, the crawler only succeeded in crawling all index areas, and the crawling of the homepage index failed again. And it was only discovered on February 22nd. I only noticed on February 28th that indices 399427, 399690, and 399691 had been quietly taken offline by the CN Securities Index Company at some unknown time. Replaced by 39936501 and 39943901. After checking the Snowball website, it was found that the last candlestick of the three disappearing indices was on April 22, 2024.
