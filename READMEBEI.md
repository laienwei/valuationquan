A Basic Fixed Investment Model
From this lesson, we will really enter the exploration journey of quantitative investment, starting with a basic and simple fixed investment model, and finally find the quantitative fixed investment model that can guide our actual operation.
###ยง1starting from a case of fixed investment
<br>Let's first look at a real case of fund fixed investment.
<br>Ms. Wang, who lives in Shanghai, invests 2000 yuan each month in four funds, and 500 yuan each time. During the five years since the beginning of the fixed investment in the middle of 2011, Ms. Wang has never changed her mind. 
<br>No matter how the A shares rise and fall, Ms. Wang has not taken any redemption action, and her fixed investment record can be regarded as a textbook fund fixed investment.
<br>According to the transaction documents, Ms. Wang chose to invest in four funds and chose the bank to apply for purchase. She invested in GF Core Selective Equity, Xingquan Organic Growth, ABC-CA Growth Equity and Harvest CSI 300 respectively. 
<br>Ms. Wang said that "these four funds were also recommended to me by my friends engaged in financial management when I made fund investment". A friend's recommendation should be the "driving force" for many people to buy funds, especially in a bull market when you happen to have a friend who works in a bank.
<br>Specifically, the selected statement of GF Core Selective shows that Ms. Wang's fixed investment in the fund started in May 2011, with an average of 500 yuan invested every month. 
<br>Until March 2016, she has invested 59 times, with a total of 29500 yuan. As of March 17, 2016, Ms. Wang held 15739.5 shares of the fund. On that day, the net value of the fund unit was 2.467 yuan, the total book assets was 38829.35 yuan, the book floating profit was 9329.35 yuan, and the fixed investment yield was 31.62%.
