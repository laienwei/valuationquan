Financial matters and investment
Ordinary people have a strong desire to save money, and usually have spare money to deposit in bank accounts. In this way, it is safe and you can enjoy a little benefits on interest. This is actually the behavior of regularly investing in bank savings projects. But we know that the interest rate of bank time deposits is very low. Low interest rate is because bank deposit is theoretically a "risk-free" investment.
ยง1 financial management is important
In the process of market investment, the rate of return is proportional to the risk. The lower the risk taken, the lower the return on investment. On the contrary, high-risk investment may be accompanied by rich returns .
Bank fixed deposit is a kind of financial behavior that everyone of us will do. With "quasi national reputation" as guarantee, it can be said to be one of the safest ways of financing. The ultra-high security doomed its ultra-low yield .
The fixed deposit interest rate of the bank will fluctuate with the development of the national economy. Take the one-year fixed deposit interest rate as an example. In 1993, it was as high as 10.98%, while in 2015, it was as low as 1.5%. In 2021, it will remain at 1.5% .
It is said: if you don't manage your money, then money ignores you.Financial management is an unavoidable choice, because the annual inflation rate is devouring the cash in our hands.The following table shows China's annual inflation rate from 1990 to 2016 .
